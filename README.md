An end to end data science project for predicting price of bangalore homes. Built a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.During model building, covered all concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction etc.Exported the model to a file and wrote a python flask server around it that served http requests generated by the UI.
Website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
